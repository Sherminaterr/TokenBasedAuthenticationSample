# Token Based Authentication Sample
This simple ASP.NET MVC example shows how you can configure Microsoft Identity without existing of any persistence layer such as SQL Server or Entity Framework. To show how Identity is fully independent from storage layer.

Also this sample uses a simple string as a token to authorize users instead of username and password to demonstrate how we can use claim based authentication feature to configure Identity in such uncommon scenarios too.
